- ML Facial recognition to detect mood and suggest songs accordingly
**Suggest Songs by Analyzing Facial Expression**

Welcome to the Suggest Songs by Analyzing Facial Expression project! This project focuses on using facial expression analysis techniques to recommend songs based on a person's emotional state. By analyzing facial expressions captured through images or video, the project determines the predominant emotion and suggests songs that match that emotion. This application enhances the user's music listening experience by providing personalized song recommendations based on their current emotional state.

**Installation**

To run this project locally, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Suggest-Songs-Facial-Expression
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
**Usage**

Once the installation is complete, you can use the project as follows:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the "Suggest_Songs_Facial_Expression.ipynb" file.

3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to load the pre-trained facial expression recognition model, capture or load facial images, analyze facial expressions, and suggest songs based on emotions.

**Dataset**

The model used in this project has been trained on a facial expression recognition dataset. However, due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. If you wish to train the model from scratch, you will need to obtain a suitable dataset and follow the data preprocessing steps outlined in the notebook.

**Disclaimer**

Please note that facial expression analysis is a complex field, and the accuracy of the model in determining emotions can vary depending on various factors such as lighting conditions, image quality, and individual variations in facial expressions. The song recommendations provided are based on general associations between emotions and music genres but may not always align with personal preferences. It is recommended to test and evaluate the system's performance and customize it based on individual needs and preferences.
